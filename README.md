Onchain engagement and reputation infrastructure for communities
# Strid3
Strid3 is an onchain engagement and reputation infrastructure that enables communities to track contributions, reward participation, and build long-term onchain reputation.

The project focuses on transforming offchain community activity into measurable onchain progress using XP, badges, and transparent reward distribution.

## 🧭 Overview

Communities today rely heavily on offchain tools such as chats, spreadsheets, and manual tracking to manage participation. These systems do not scale, lack transparency, and fail to build lasting reputation.

Stride provides a unified onchain layer that allows communities to:
- Track meaningful contributions
- Reward participants fairly
- Prove participation onchain
- Improve retention and long-term engagement


## 🧱 Core Components (Planned)

### Smart Contracts
- XP / Points Ledger  
- Reward Pool Contracts  
- NFT Badge Contracts  
- Event-based contribution tracking  

### Frontend
- User dashboard (XP, badges, activity)
- Leaderboards
- Task and challenge interface
- Admin dashboard for community managers

### Backend Services
- Task verification
- Challenge automation
- Metadata indexing
- API endpoints

## 🚧 Project Status

Strid3 is currently in **early development / MVP planning**.

Initial work includes:
- UX and flow design
- Smart contract architecture planning
- Visual prototypes
- Grant-supported MVP development

Code will be pushed incrementally as development begins.

## 🗺 Roadmap (High Level)

- MVP smart contracts (XP, rewards, badges)
- Frontend dashboard and admin tools
- Pilot with early communities
- Public testnet deployment
- Iterative improvements based on feedback

## 🤝 Contributions

This project is open-source and welcomes community contributions once the MVP phase begins.
